Scenario:
Gerard is reviewing CVs for a new software development position. He wants a candidate whose online CV is organized, visually appealing, and easy to scan. When visiting Antoni Cotrina’s website, he should instantly understand his role, skills, and experience, without distractions.

-Information architecture:

The website follows a single page layout divided into clear sections that guide the viewer clearly through the content.
At the top, the header contains the candidate’s name (Antoni Cotrina), job title, profile picture, and contact information, making it easy to identify and reach out.

The main body is divided into two main columns to have a good distribution and dont make the page boring with only one part. On the left side, the user can read the main sections of the CV:

About me, offering a short introduction and a background in general.

Work experience i had (being professional and non-professional), listing previous roles, achievements, and responsibilities.

Languages that i speak, which gives a quick overview of communication abilities.

On the right side, there is a dedicated Skills section, designed as a colorful sidebar. It uses badges to display both technical and soft skills, helping the recruiter easily identify key strengths.

Finally, the footer closes the page with copyright information.

This structure provides a balance between readability and visual hierarchy, making for sure that all critical information is visible without scrolling excessively, while maintaining a professional appearance and a modern touch so as not to bore the user who sees this.

-Visual design:

The visual design aims to communicate professionalism and clarity, with a modern and clean aesthetic. The color palette combines with all blue tones (light, normal, deep) to show trust, confidence, and creativity, ideal for a technology and focused professional. The background is light, ensuring good contrast and easy readability.

Typography is Segoe UI and Arial, simple and accessible fonts that work well on both desktop and mobile screens and it doesn't make the text too complex

The layout is two columns, where the left side holds the main content because to make the first thing to read on left and the right side features the highlighted skills section to make it the last thing to read. This structure gives visual balance and helps guide the reader’s attention to the most relevant details and not have distractions to unnecessary things.

Rounded profile pictures and section dividers with subtle shadows add a sense of friendly with a little modern touch to the design.
The skills section uses colored tags to create visual dynamism and immediately catch the attention without boring the viewer with default typography design.
Overall, the design focuses on simplicity, modern, balance, and harmony, providing a professional and visually pleasant user experience (In this case, the human resources specialist).
